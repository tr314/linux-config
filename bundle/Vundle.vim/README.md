## About

[Vundle] is short for _Vim bundle_ and is a [Vim] plugin manager.

[Vundle] allows you to...

* keep track of and [configure] your plugins right in the `.vimrc`
* [install] configured plugins (a.k.a. scripts/bundle)
* [update] configured plugins
* [search] by name all available [Vim scripts]
* [clean] unused plugins up
* run the above actions in a *single keypress* with [interactive mode]

[Vundle] automatically...

* manages the [runtime path] of your installed scripts
* regenerates [help tags] after installing and updating

[Vundle] is undergoing an [interface change], please stay up to date to get latest changes.

## Quick Start

1. Introduction:

   Installation requires [Git] and triggers [`git clone`] for each configured repository to `~/.vim/bundle/` by default.
   Curl is required for search.

   If you are using Windows, go directly to [Windows setup]. If you run into any issues, please consult the [FAQ].
   See [Tips] for some advanced configurations.

   Using non-POSIX shells, such as the popular Fish shell, requires additional setup. Please check the [FAQ].

2. Set up [Vundle]:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
   ```

3. Configure Plugins:

   Put this at the top of your `.vimrc` to use Vundle. You may have to create a `.vimrc` file if it doesn't already exist at `~/.vimrc`. Remove plugins you don't need, they are for illustration purposes.

   ```vim
   set nocompatible              " be iMproved, required
   filetype off                  " required

   " set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
   set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
   call vundle#begin()
   " alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
   "call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

   " let Vundle manage Vundle, required
   Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

   " The following are examples of different formats supported.
   " Keep Plugin commands between vundle#begin/end.
   " plugin on GitHub repo
   Plugin 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
   " plugin from http://vim-scripts.org/vim/scripts.html
   " Plugin 'L9'
   " Git plugin not hosted on GitHub
   Plugin 'git://git.wincent.com/command-t.git'
   " git repos on your local machine (i.e. when working on your own plugin)
   Plugin 'file:///home/gmarik/path/to/plugin'
   " The sparkup vim script is in a subdirectory of this repo called vim.
   " Pass the path to set the runtimepath properly.
   Plugin 'rstacruz/sparkup', {'rtp': 'vim/'}
   " Install L9 and avoid a Naming conflict if you've already installed a
   " different version somewhere else.
   " Plugin 'ascenator/L9', {'name': 'newL9'}

   " All of your Plugins must be added before the following line
   call vundle#end()            " required
   filetype plugin indent on    " required
   " To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
   "filetype plugin on
   "
   " Brief help
   " :PluginList       - lists configured plugins
   " :PluginInstall    - installs plugins; append `!` to update or just :PluginUpdate
   " :PluginSearch foo - searches for foo; append `!` to refresh local cache
   " :PluginClean      - confirms removal of unused plugins; append `!` to auto-approve removal
   "
   " see :h vundle for more details or wiki for FAQ
   " Put your non-Plugin stuff after this line
   ```

4. Install Plugins:

   Launch `vim` and run `:PluginInstall`

   To install from command line: `vim +PluginInstall +qall`

5. (optional) For those using the fish shell: add `set shell=/bin/bash` to your `.vimrc`

## Inspiration & Ideas

* [pathogen.vim](http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/)
* [Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler)
* [Scott Bronson](http://github.com/bronson)

## Also

* Vundle was developed and tested with [Vim] 7.3 on OS X, Linux and Windows
* Vundle tries to be as [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) as possible

## TODO
[Vundle] is a work in progress, so any ideas and patches are appreciated.

* [x] activate newly added bundles on `.vimrc` reload or after `:PluginInstall`
* [x] use preview window for search results
* [x] Vim documentation
* [x] put Vundle in `bundles/` too (will fix Vundle help)
* [x] tests
* [x] improve error handling
* [ ] allow specifying revision/version?
* [ ] handle dependencies
* [ ] show description in search results
* [ ] search by description as well
* [ ] make it rock!
